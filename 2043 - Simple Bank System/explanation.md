## Approach:

1.  **Account Validation**: All transactions must check if the account numbers are within the valid range (1 to `n`, where `n` is the number of accounts).
2.  **Balance Validation**: For `withdraw` and `transfer`, verify that the account has sufficient balance before proceeding.
3.  **Transaction Execution**:
    *   **Transfer**: Deduct `money` from `account1` and add it to `account2`.
    *   **Deposit**: Add `money` to the specified account.
    *   **Withdraw**: Deduct `money` from the specified account.
4.  **Efficiency**: All operations are O(1) time complexity since they involve simple checks and arithmetic operations.


## Explanation
*   **Initialization**: The `Bank` constructor stores the initial balances and the number of accounts (`n`).
*   **Transfer**: Checks if both accounts are valid and if `account1` has enough balance. If valid, transfers `money` from `account1` to `account2`.
*   **Deposit**: Validates the account number and adds `money` to the account.
*   **Withdraw**: Validates the account number and checks if the balance covers the withdrawal amount before deducting.
*   **Edge Cases**: Handles invalid account numbers (outside 1 to `n`) and insufficient balances by returning `false` immediately.
