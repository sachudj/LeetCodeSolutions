## Approach:

To solve this problem, we use mathematical insights to avoid brute-force iteration, ensuring optimal performance.

1. Total Sum Calculation: Compute the sum of all integers from 1 to `n` using the formula $`n(n+1)/2`$.
2. Sum of Multiples of m: Calculate the sum of all integers divisible by `m` in the range `[1, n]`. This is derived as $`m×(k(k+1)/2)`$, where $`k=|n/m|`$.
3. Result Calculation: The desired result is `total_sum − 2 × num2`, since `num1 = total_sum − num2`, and `num1 − num2 = total_sum − 2 × num2`.


#### Code Walkthrough:

1. Initialization: The input string s starts with a length of at least 3.
2. Loop Until Length 2:
    - For each iteration, create a new string by processing every pair of consecutive digits in s.
    - Each pair's sum is taken modulo 10, and the result is added to the new string.
3. Termination Check: When the string length reduces to 2, compare the two digits. If they are the same, return True; otherwise, return False.
