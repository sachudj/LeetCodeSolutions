# LeetCodeSolutions

A personal repo to track LeetCode problems I solve, with quick explanations and reference implementations.

Structure (example)

```python
  solutions/
  ├── 001 - Two Sum/
  │   ├── problem.md
  │   ├── solution.py
  │   ├── explanation.md
  │   └── complexity.md
  └── ...
```

- each problem folder is named with the LeetCode ID and a short title
- recommended files:
  - problem.md — statement excerpt, constraints, link
  - solution.py — reference implementation
  - explanation.md — approach, key ideas, edge cases
  - complexity.md — time/space complexity
