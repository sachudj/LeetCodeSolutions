## Approach:

To solve this problem, we simulate the described operation repeatedly until the string has exactly two digits. The key steps involve processing consecutive digit pairs, computing their sum modulo 10, and updating the string iteratively.

1. Problem Analysis: The problem requires reducing a string of digits by repeatedly replacing each pair of consecutive digits with their sum modulo 10. This continues until the string length becomes 2.
2. Intuition: Each operation reduces the string length by 1. For a string of length `n`, we need `n-2` operations to reach length 2.
3. Algorithm:
    - While the string length is greater than 2, iterate through the string to compute new digits as `(current_digit + next_digit) % 10`.
    - Replace the string with the newly computed digits.
    - Once the string length is 2, check if both digits are identical.


#### Code Walkthrough:

1. Initialization: The input string s starts with a length of at least 3.
2. Loop Until Length 2:
    - For each iteration, create a new string by processing every pair of consecutive digits in s.
    - Each pair's sum is taken modulo 10, and the result is added to the new string.
3. Termination Check: When the string length reduces to 2, compare the two digits. If they are the same, return True; otherwise, return False.
